## ðŸš€ My Portfolio

This is my personal website built using gatsby on the front-end and sanity.io on the backend.

This is still the first version as I plan to make more updates to the website and some the codes needs to be refactored

If you plan on using this template for your own portfolio please make sure to go through the sanity setup and configuration.

You can visit the [sanity](https://www.sanity.io/docs/create-a-sanity-project?ref=hero) documentation to know how it works.

I'll be updating the readme as I make more updates to the project.
